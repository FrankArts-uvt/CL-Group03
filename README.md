# CL-Group03
Computational Linguistics - Code Submission (by Group 3)

The codeBase_Group3.py python file can be used for easily building our best-performing language model. Only the train_path and test_path variables need to be updated according to where you have stored your datasets. After that, the code can be run as it is, and it will print out occasional status updates, followed by the perplexity of our language model.

The codeBase_Group3.ipynb notebook file can also be used for building our best-performing language model. However, this is the notebook that we used for testing several different types of language models, so it contains some code that is not relevant for the final evaluation.
